# About Easel
Data visualization can be a powerful tool for analyzing and communicating data. However, the overwhelming diversity of options for visualization make it difficult to know how to most effectively visualize data given a specific task. Easel, a visualization recommendation system, was built in response to this problem, specifically for university educators and education support staff looking to improve their visualization techniques of educational data. Its purpose is two-fold: 

* Guide a user towards well-formed questions regarding your educational data.
* Provide recommendations for visualizations that will help answer those questions.

The recommended visualizations were created using a design processes and principles outlined in visualization literature, largely from [Munzer's Visualization Analysis and Design](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/). We repurposed a visualization selection methodology for the context of education, which can be found by clicking the Selection Process option above along with examples of its usage.

Easel was built using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), a reactive web-application framework for R.  To view the current (development) version of Easel, please visit [shiny.engineering.queensu.ca/easel](shiny.engineering.queensu.ca/easel)
