**What data to use**

- Students in programed
- Student demographic data

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each block represents a course, categorized by year of study. The intensity of the filled in colour shows you how much of that demographic group has taken each course. Courses that are very popular or unpoular are easily identified. If the outline is a similar colour intensity as the box, it indicates that the course is propotionally popular with the total population of students. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The extremes of the porportion of students taking the course is the primary goal here. The courses however, have an implicit ordering by year, so they were divided accordingly. The varying colour pallete allows for easy identification of values that are on the extremes. For reference, the additional value was added in a secondary way to be able to reference against, but without hindering the main visualization objective.
