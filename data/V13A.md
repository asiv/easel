**What data to use**

- Student assessment results of various types
- General Student data

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
The visualization shows students listed as rows down the side. For each student, the visualization provides them with a "badge" if they achieve the specified criteria that is entered into the code. 
This visualization lets you easily identify how many students are achieving a specific criteria, and what combination of criteria any particular student is achieving. The visualization also uses colour to point out badges that are good, bad, or neutral with green, red, and blue respectively. 
This visualization requires some knowledge of the programming language to define the specific criteria.

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal of this question is to identify which students are achieving some set of criteria. The students therefore are not reduced and all listed. Additionally, the badges are made small so that they can all be shown at once and easily consumed.
