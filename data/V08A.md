**What data to use**

- Student group peer-assessment data from before
- Student group peer-assessment data from later

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each bar in this visualization represents the final score that a student assigned a team member from a peer-evaluation form. The visualization is then segmented into each student that is assigning the ratings. 
The green and red bars represent how their evaluations of team-members (and themselves) has changed between evaluations. The top of each grey bar however, represents the final score. Red bars below 0 indicate how much their mark has been lowered by and the green bars represent how much they have increased by. Additionally, the blue border signals when the it is a self-evaluation. 
In this example visualization, we can see that Raj generally improved their opinion of the team members. While, with Jamie, we can see that there was no change in their opinion of the members, except for Cara, who Jamie thought has done much worse since. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Here, the key was showing how ratings have *changed* between evaluations. Accordingly, the changes in evaluations is what is shown in colour, while the final marks are left to the background with the grey colour.
