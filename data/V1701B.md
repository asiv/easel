**What data to use**

- Student assessment results
- Student demographic data

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
In this visualization, each section of the circle represents the students that are part of that group. The portion of the circle conveys how large of a segment that group is in the class. The distance of the portion from the centre represents the mean of the results of the students in that particular group. Also provided through the form of error bars is the standard deviation for each group. 
This visualization lets you see how each group is performing in comparison to each other, while also gaining a sense of the size of each group. The portions are ordered naturally by the grouping they are ordered by. 
*Viewers should be cautious however* with the error bars, since grade distributions do not tend to look like perfect normal distributions. 
In this example visualization we see the groups making up the largest portions of the class, born 1994 and 1995, perform very similarly, while those born in 1993 seem to perform statistically higher, though they make up a small portion of the class. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal of this question is to see whether there is any relationship between a certain student grouping and overall performance. Bars are the simplest way to present a mean and standard deviation. 
Using a circular coordinate system makes it more immediately apparent that the groups are part of a whole.
