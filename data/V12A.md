**What data to use**

- Students results from an assessment

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
The visualization shows a histogram of student results coloured by whether they are above or below a chosen threshold. 
This visualization provides a richer method of expressing how a class is performing around a certain threshold. 
In this example visualization we can clearly see that there is a large peak of students that fall just below the threshold, even though the majority of students are above it. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal of this question is see how the class is performing with an emphasis on a certain number. The colours give a quick sense of how students above and below are performing. The numbers written on top give a sense of the scale as well.
