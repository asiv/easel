**What data to use**

- Individual student assessment results from pre-requisite course
- Student IDs
- Whether student is in current course

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
The visualization shows two superimposed histograms of class performance. The darker histogram is the performance of the entire previous course, while the lighter grey histogram is that of the subset of students in the current course. There is a line of each colour to mark the means of entire course and subset respectively. 
This visualization lets you see what subset of students the current course has in comparison to the entire previous course. 
In this example visualization, you can see that the largest bin in the entire class, around 2.6, is not refelected in the student subset. So while the average of the subset is only slightly higher, the distribution is a lot flatter in the subset than the whole. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal of this visualization is to compare the subset of students' performance to that of the entire class. Super imposed histograms work well to convey where the differences are in peaks and dips of the distributions.
