**What data to use**: *Student ID*, *Student demographic data*, *Assessment result*

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each bar here represents the mean of the subset of students to whom that that grouping applies. In this case the a student can be in multiple groups. Compare the bars to see whether there are any groups that are performing significantly different than the rest. The red line provides the mean for all students to compare against. Additionally, the colour of each bar provides information about how many students are within each group. In this example, students can be in one of the three academic plans (Arts, Eng, or Psych) but also be either in or out of the Bachelor or Education program (Yes or No). Here, we see that students in the BEd program are performing a few points lower than the average, alluding that it is probably the largest factor in a given student's performance. There are significantly less students who are in the BEd program than not in the program.

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Since students can be in multiple of these groups, there is no way to encode the proportionality of each. The primary goal is to see how each group is doing so bar charts work well for comparing single dimension data. The line also provides some context with which to compare each group to. Since have a sense of how large each group is, this additional information is encoded into the filled in colour.
