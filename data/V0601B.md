**What data to use**

- Student assessment results from previous course
- Results from diagnostic assessment

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
In the visualization, you can see two histograms of a set of student's performance facetted next to each other. Each histogram represents a measure of student grades from different times. Each histogram can be analyzed separately, but are also aligned so that individual bins can be compared easily. In this example, we can see that while previously, the distribution was bi-modal, the more recent measurement shows that students follow a single-mode distribution more clearly. Additionally, the students grades tend to be higher. Make sure to try various numbers of bins. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
For this purpose, we would like to see how the distribution of grades among the students has changed. Faceting them makes it easy to analyze either histogram without distraction, but aligns them up easily for comparison. Additionally, this approach lets you compare more than two sets of measurements, unlike with superimposing.
