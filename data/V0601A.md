**What data to use**

- Student assessment results from previous course
- Results from diagnostic assessment

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
In the visualization, you can see two histograms of a set of student's performance superimposed on each other. Each histogram represents a measure of student grades from different times. The darker histogram is of the prior measurement, while the lighter grey histogram is of the more recent measurement. In this example, we can see that while previously, the distribution was bi-modal, the more recent measurement shows that students follow a single-mode distribution more clearly. Additionally, the students grades tend to be higher. Make sure to try various numbers of bins. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
For this purpose, we would like to see how the distribution of grades among the students has changed. By superimposing them and reducing the transparency of the closer one, the distributions can be easily compared. This design is especially useful to see where spikes in a histogram are and how they compare to the prior or more recent measurement.
