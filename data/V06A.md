**What data to use**

- Student assessment results from previous course
- Results from diagnostic assessment

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each line represents a student. The line starts at where how the student performed previously and how they performed now. Students that are doing a lot worse or a lot better than when previously tested are emphasized by the colour gradient. These students can be identified early on to ensure they are being adequately supported. In the example above, the dark blue lines represent students that are doing significantly better, while the dark red lines identify students that are doing relatively worse that previously. The white lines in the background are students whose performance has remained relatively the same. This visualization should only be used on groups of students smaller than 100. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
It was important to clearly see which students have made the most differnece. By using parallel coordinates, each student can be seen and empahsized by whether they did significantly better or worse. Opacity could be used for additional emphasis. With the addition of interactivity, the student numbers can be easily identified.
