**What data to use**

- Student assessment results from previous course
- Results from diagnostic assessment

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Students that are doing a lot worse or a lot better than when previously tested are emphasized by the colour gradient. These students can be identified early on to ensure they are being adequately supported. Should only be used on groups below 100. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
It was important to clearly see which students have made the most differnece. By using parallel coordinates, each student can be seen and empahsized by whether they did significantly better or worse. Opacity could be used for additional emphasis.
