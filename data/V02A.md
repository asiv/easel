**What data to use**

- Results from various assessments
- Student IDs

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Students are arranged by their results on a performance. Look across the rows to see if students are performing significantly different from their first or final performance. For instance, in the example shown, it is clear to identify students that were either originally perfoming well and have lowered their mark, or vice versa. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Since, both the individual student and assessment performance were important, neither could be reduced. Since there are two Keys, each assessment for each student needed to be visible. By arranging the students based on a single assessment, the values that are not arranged in the other columns are more easily highlighted. The interactivity was added to give more precision, since luminosity is a poor channel for perceiving numeric values.
