**What data to use**
- Results from various assessments
- Student IDs

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?**
Each row represents a student and each column represents an assessment. The intensity of each cell points out how a student performed on an assessment. Students are arranged by their results on a performance of your choice. Look across the rows to see if students are performing significantly different from their first or final performance. For instance, in the example shown, students that were either originally performing well and have lowered their mark, or vice versa are clearly identifiable. In the second column of this example, we can also see that all the students did not do as well collectively, while in the third column we can see a number of students who have done much better since their prior performance.  

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Since, both the individual student and assessment performance were important, neither could be reduced. Since there are two Keys, each assessment for each student needed to be visible. By arranging the students based on a single assessment, the values that are not arranged in the other columns are more easily highlighted. The interactivity was added to give more precision, since luminosity is a poor channel for perceiving numeric values.
