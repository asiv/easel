*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
The visualization shows a line representing graduation rates for different groups over multiple years. In this case, graduation rates are calculated as the number of students that graduate within 7 years of starting their program. 
This visualization lets you see how the graduate rates compare for the different groups to be able to easily identify if there are any groups are graduating at rates different to the majority. 
In this example visualization we see that while students with Citizen or Resident status are graduating at roughly the same rates, International students are graduating at much lower rates and might require some investigation. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal of this question is to compare trends among groups over time. The points clearly show the change in graduation rates and the lines connect them to easily see if there is some trend worth noticing.
