**What data to use**

- Student group peer-assessment data from before
- Student group peer-assessment data from later

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each bar in this visualization represents the final score that a student was assigned by a team member from a peer-evaluation form. So the first set of bars represents how Cara was rated by their team members. 
The green and red bars represent how their evaluations from team-members (and themselves) has changed between evaluations. The top of each grey bar represents the final score. Red bars below 0 indicate how much their rating has been lowered by and the green bars represent how much the rating has increased by. Additionally, the blue border signals when the it is a self-evaluation. 
In this example visualization, we can see that the team seems to only see Alex having improved since the previous evaluation, while also generally doing quite well. While, with Jamie, we can see that all other team members lowered their evaluation of Jamie since the prior assessment. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Here, the key was showing how ratings have *changed* between evaluations. Accordingly, the changes in evaluations is what is shown in colour, while the final evaluations are left to the background with the grey colour.
